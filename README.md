`furigana` is an easy to use interactive web app aim to help you learn the Japanese language. When you copy and paste a Japanese text, the app should show the most essential parts to read, pronounce and understand the language.

1. The first part is 'Furigana', which translates Kanji into its corresponding sound, and you should be able to read the text out if you already know Hiragana.

2. The second part is 'Romaji'. For any beginner who don't even know how to pronounce Hiragana, Romaji sure will help if you already know English. But this is only for absolute beginners, my advice is to learn how to read and pronounce Hiragana as soon as possible and stop relying on Romaji to pronounce Japanese text. Because Hiragana does not just represent sounds, it itself represents the actually meaning of the language! Therefore the app should provide toggle function to show/hide Romaji to prevent over relying on Romaji.

3. Finally the third part should be the translation of the meaning of text. It should come from Google Translate engine. Currently I planned to support English and Traditional Chinese, because these are my native languages.

4. Optionally, if the app can provide a read-out-loud function would be great. But it depend if there is a handful of third-party APIs.
